#### Editing video

QuickTime Player has a screen recording mode (under File > New Screen Recording).  The stop button will be up in the menu bar.

#### VLC

- Drag and drop a source movie file onto the VLC window.  
- Hit the spacebar to stop playback.
- Drag the little circle in the slot at the bottom to where you want to start recording.

- Select Playback > Record
- Play the video up until where you want to end it.  Hit the spacebar to stop.
- Click on Record again to **de-select** it.

The new recording will be in your default location.  

This can be changed under Preferences > Input / Codecs.

There is an option under File > Advanced Open File to open a file with the start and stop times specified.  But the record method doesn't work if I do that. 

Also, note that the quality of the output is less (and file size smaller) from VLC compared to iMovie.  I'm not clear on how to set that, either.

#### iMovie

In iMovie, import the movie file.  

After import, at the top left, click on the icon for the clip, it should acquire a yellow outline with "handles".

Drag the handles to select where to trim the clip.  I remove a bunch of extra material (where I fumbled about trying to figure how to terminate the screen capture).  This is shown on the left in the image below

Next, create a new movie by clicking on "My Movie".  The file dialog is shown on the right in the image below.

When you have created a movie, you should see an area at the bottom of the screen

where you are supposed to drag clips.  Here we are after the drag.

It looks funny because the default resolution is low.  Adjust the slider at the upper right of this (bottom) panel.

I removed three frames from the beginning by clicking at the cut point (setting the "playhead"), and then choosing

- Modify > Trim To Playhead

Make sure the crop style is "Fit".

Export the modified clip by using 

- File > Share > File
